First, make sure that your Linux server has a desktop environment installed. If it does not, you can install one using the following command on your server: sudo apt-get install xfce4.

Next, install and configure a Remote Desktop server on your Linux server. One popular option is xrdp. You can install it using the following command: sudo apt-get install xrdp. Once it's installed, you may need to configure it to run automatically on boot. You can do this using the following command: sudo systemctl enable xrdp.

Configure your Linux server's firewall to allow incoming RDP connections. You can do this using the following command: sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp. Note that this will open the RDP port (TCP 3389) to all incoming connections, so make sure that you have strong authentication credentials to prevent unauthorized access.

On your Windows PC, open the Remote Desktop Connection client. You can do this by searching for "Remote Desktop Connection" in the Start menu.

In the Remote Desktop Connection client, enter your Linux server's IP address and click "Connect".

You'll be prompted to enter your login credentials for your Linux server. Enter your username and password and click "OK".

If everything is configured correctly, you should now be connected to your Linux server's desktop environment via RDP.

Note that RDP can be a potential security risk if not properly secured, so make sure to use strong authentication credentials and consider using a VPN or SSH tunnel to secure your connection.
